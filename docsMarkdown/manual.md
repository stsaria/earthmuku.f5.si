# 1. What is EarthMuku?
EarthMuku is a server that contains a world that reproduces the Earth and plug-ins that allow you to create towns and countries.
Basically, the first thing you do is the same as in Survival.
However, this server has currency and towns/countries.
The currency is emeralds, so the number of villagers is increased compared to normal worlds.
However, they do not all have positions.
# 2. Enter EarthMuku
IP:`play.earthmuku.f5.si` Version:1.9~latest
When you enter EarthMuku, you will spawn in a town called WorldSpawn.
Then, when you leave the town for a bit, you will see the word Wildness in the bar below. (There is no town here, but you can dig underground and dig trees.)
You can survive there.
# 3. Creating and expanding the town
When you have 32 emeralds or more, you can create a town.
Go to the place you want to create and type `/t new TOWNNAME` to create a town. (You will get a confirmation for creating a town. You can approve it by typing `/confirm`)
To enlarge the town (by one chunk), type `/t claim`. (6 emeralds)
# 4. Town to country
When you have collected more than 64 emeralds, you can create a country.
You can create a country with `/n new NATIONNAME`.
